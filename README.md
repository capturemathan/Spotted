## Objective
> It’s no surprise that India has more number of child missing cases and no adequate methods to find them. Only about 50% of them are found : THE HINDU
<li>An app that helps in finding missing people using facial recognition, digital footprints and crowdsourcing by storing details of missing people in a secure
database accessible only by authorities.
<li>The common people are provided with an app to report the same.

## Possible Cases
### 1. When a child is missing in a crowded place like malls and known <b> immediately </b>

<br/> <br/>
<li> The child’s face is fed into the app by the acquaintance.
<li> Then a certain distance is set as radius that the child could have possibly covered.
<li> Then the child’s face is searched in all the nearby cameras in malls,hotels and restaurants in that area.
<li> Once <b>Spotted</b> information is given to the police officials.

### 2. When a person affected by Dementia, Alzheimer’s e.t.c is missing

<br /> <br /> 
<li> He/She might only go to places that is stored in memory.
<li> So by the use of digital footprints, his/her favourite go-to places and frequently visited places are collected.
<li> Then a pattern of where the person might have possibly gone is reported to the officials.

### 3. Child has been missing for a while, without knowing the location and time of missing.

<br /> <br /> 
<li> Our app uses the crowdsource to make the search easier.
<li> When a child is spotted by public, he/she can take an upload the photo and location in our app.
<li> The app compares the photo with the existing records in database collected from each local police station.
<li> When the record is matched, the police station nearest to child’s location is informed.
